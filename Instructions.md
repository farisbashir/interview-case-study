Hello,

In this project I use Laravel framework. I managed to comple all the tasks but I 
do not have enough time to do the bonus task. Down below I have listed 
the steps to run my project.

1) Run xampp control panel and start Apache & MySQL.

2) Open browser and go to this link, http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php

3) Make sure your device can open MINGW64 terminal. Go to my folder 
	
	cd ..\Supplycart_Case_Study\Supplycart_Task

4)Type in
	php artisan serve.

5)If everything is success, open browser and go to this link. http://127.0.0.1:8000

6)Thats all, Thank you.
